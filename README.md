CONTENT SUMMARIZATION TOOL:
--------------------------
This project is a content summarization tool. The tool allows users to enter text, and then provides a summary of the text.

To work on this project, we have to follow the following steps:

1.DATA COLLECTION:

We collected various PDFs that don't contain images or formulas.
These PDFs serve as the input for this project.

2.DATA PREPROCESSING:

The collected PDFs are preprocessed by tokenizing the text data, removing stop words and punctuation, and converting the data into a format suitable for modeling.

3.MODEL SELECTION AND FINE TUNING:

In every project, the model section is of great importance. For this project, we selected the T5 (Text-to-Text Transformer Transformation) model. T5 is an encoder-decoder model that transforms all NLP problems into a text-to-text format and we used nltk. We must fine-tune the model with the collected PDFs and then refine the model.

4.EVALUATION OF THE MODEL:

We need to train and test the model with the pdfs that we collected. After training and testing, we need to evaluate the model based on the needs of the project.

5.DEPLOYMENT:

 For deployment of this content summarization tool, we used a framework called streamlit. Streamlit is an open-source Python framework.
